üèÜ 18-Week DSA Mastery Challenge

Overview
    Welcome to my journey of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) over the next 18 weeks! This self-challenge is designed to deepen my problem-solving skills, 
    improve coding efficiency, and strengthen my understanding of complex data structures in a structured timeline. Feel free to follow along and join in if you'd like to 
    take on a similar challenge!

Challenge Goals
    Understand and implement fundamental data structures and algorithms.
    Enhance problem-solving skills through regular practice and progressive difficulty levels.
    Prepare for technical interviews with consistent coding practice.
